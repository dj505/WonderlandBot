# WonderlandBot
A Discord server bot originally by 916253 and ihaveamac/ihaveahax, heavily modified by dj505. Remodelled to be more widely used in a variety of servers, manily [Wonderland Corp.](https://discord.gg/WphDny9)
All the moderation tools and major things are from their respective authors, and I take no credit whatsoever. All I did was change the name and make it more suited to everyday use.

This bot is capable has many things, such as:
* A currency system (currently does not have a use)
* A few moderation tools
* A not too terrible not not great reaction gif/text system
* xkcd comic parser to grab comics by number, randomly, or even by certain phrases
* An addon system, which should be easy enough to get the gist of from looking at existing addons

## Requirements:
* Python 3.5 or above
* [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). Be sure to use the latest version for best results.
