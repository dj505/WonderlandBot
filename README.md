# WonderlandBot

A super simple Discord bot written in Python using discord.py.
All configurations are stored in .ini files because json is slightly more difficult and I'm lazy. Also it's easy to access.

# What can it do?

Not much. It has:
* A not-terrible-but-not-great currency system
* A simple custom commands/reaction gif system
* Easy configurations using .ini files
* A ton of extraneous modules imported
* No comments in the code

# How do I set it up?

1. Have Python3 installed
2. Install discord.py using pip
3. Edit the configuration files to suit your bot's account as detailed in each .ini file (settings.ini is the main one)
4. Modify code to suit your needs
5. ???
6. Profit
