# WonderlandBot
A Discord server bot originally by 916253 and ihaveamac/ihaveahax, heavily modified by dj505. Remodelled to be more widely used in a variety of servers, manily [Wonderland Corp.](https://discord.gg/WphDny9)
All the moderation tools and major things are from their respective authors, and I take no credit whatsoever. All I did was change the name and make it more suited to everyday use.

This bot is capable has many things, such as:
* A currency system (currently does not have a use)
* Many moderation tools
* Nintendo Friend Code database for sharing FCs
* A not too terrible not not great reaction gif/text system
* xkcd comic parser to grab comics by number, randomly, or even by certain phrases
* A parser for [a certain esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) (Not enabled by default, can be loaded with `c?load addons.bf` or `c?load bf`)
* An addon system, with an example addon file to get you started

## Requirements:
* Python 3.5 or above
* [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). Be sure to use the latest version for best results.
